WinInstall
==========

A custom installer for Windows from Windows PE.

This will install Windows from WIM files.



The script is designed to be run from windows PE. (it can run from normal computers also. I tested it from my computer *Windows 8*)

This method is also basically future proof, as long am MS keeps using WIM files.
