WinInstall
==========

A custom installer for Windows from Windows PE.

This will install Windows from WIM files.

I need some help on partitioning disks from the command prompt.


I am planning on using Windows PE 3 (Windows 7).

This version is compatible with most computers. 

Plus it is basically future proof, as long am MS keeps using WIMs.
